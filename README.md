## Introduction

Hello everyone ! My name is Ã‰lodie Riou. I'm 31 years old and I finished the first year
at Holberton Schoo: THE FOUNDATIONS. 

The aim of the project was to create a web application to put into contact people with
difficulties with FabLab who can provide them with solutions to make their lives easier.

This project was initiate by the association Mayâ€™Human Lab of Laval in Mayenne(53).

### The objectives

The objective of the portfolio project was to create an MVP (Most Viable Product)
during 3 weeks. But not only. We had to create a landing page, a demo on Youtube,
a blog post and a wonderful README.

### The challenges

The challenges of my project was to create a simple interface, easier to use.
Next, it was the implementation of Django. 

I choose Django because is popular and offer tons of libraries and tools for common 
use cases (ORM, authentication, HTML templating, URL routing, forms, view layers, 
model layers). Then, Django offers a fully-featured web interface for the admin panel. 
Finally, there is a very good documentation with example code which is very helpful 
in building some features.
